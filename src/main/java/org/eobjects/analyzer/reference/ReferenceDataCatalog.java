/**
 * Represents a catalog of items that are considered as reference data that a
 * user can choose to utilize in various analyzers, transformers etc.
 * 
 * Reference data is typically reusable between jobs which is why it is
 * contained within the configuration of AnalyzerBeans. For example you could
 * have a dictionary of valid values for a particular entity type. This
 * dictionary is then resuable both as input to a Dictionary validation filter
 * and an analyzer that will match values against different dictionaries.
 * 
 * All reference data types (Dictionary, SynonymCatalog etc.) is injectable into
 * components using the @Configured annotation.
