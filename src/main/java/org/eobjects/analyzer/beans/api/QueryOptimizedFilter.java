/**
 * A filter which can, under certain circumstances, be optimized by using a
 * "push down" technique, where the filter's functionality is expressed in the
 * query that feeds the job that the filter is entered into.
 * 
 * Query optimized filters should implement BOTH the regular categorize(...)
 * method and the optimization-methods in this interface. There is no guarantee
 * that the filter will be optimizing the query, but in cases where a filter is
 * among the first steps in a job, and all succeeding steps depend on a single
 * outcome of the particular filter, it will be allowed to optimize the query.
