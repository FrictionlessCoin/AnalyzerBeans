 * When the result is done it may either be successful or errornous. Clients can
 * find out using the isSuccessful() or isErrornous() methods.
 * 
 * If succesful, the results can be retrieved using the getResults() method. If
 * errornous the error messages can be retrieved using the getErrors() method.
 * If the analysis was only partly errornous, there may be both result and
 * errors, but isSuccesful() will return false.
